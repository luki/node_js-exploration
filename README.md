# Node.js Exploration
A self-study project

## Motiviation
It's very likely I'll be interning at a local company in Software Development,
therefore I'm wanting to get familiar with their technology of choice.
Node.js is one of them.

## Note
I wasn't asked to do this, it's bare self-motivation that led to this.
